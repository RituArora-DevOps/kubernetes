Hi, I am Ritu Arora. 
I am gaining practical experience to get into the field of DevOps and cloud engineering. 
This repository will serve to showcase my portfolio projects to the recruiters.
I have been learning since last one year about Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
Along with that my major focus is on learning modern DevOps tools and 
agile methodology to automate and efficiently manage the SDLC. 

Here in this Kubernetes repository, you can find numerous projects on Kubernetes.

Let's get started.
